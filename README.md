# Math Buddy

Everyone needs a friend, especially when learning math.

## Install

Open your favorite Terminal app! [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is good if you do not have a favorite.

1. Install `brew`: https://brew.sh
2. Install `go`: `brew install go`
3. Install `cowsay` (optional, but more fun): `brew install cowsay`
4. Install this project: `go install github.com/polothy/go-math-tui@latest`
